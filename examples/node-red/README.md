# Ambientika – Node-RED Flow

This folder contains an importable Node-RED flow for controlling Ambientika ventilation units via the [Ambientika MQTT Bridge](../../README.md).

## Prerequisites

1. **Ambientika MQTT Bridge** is running and connected to your MQTT broker  
   → See [main README](../../README.md) for setup instructions
2. **Node-RED** installed (standalone, as Home Assistant add-on, or on Raspberry Pi)
3. **MQTT broker** running (e.g., Mosquitto on localhost:1883)

## Import the Flow

1. Open Node-RED in your browser (default: http://localhost:1880)
2. Click the **≡ menu** (top right) → **Import**
3. Click **"select a file to import"** and choose `ambientika-flow.json`  
   – or paste the JSON content directly
4. Click **Import**
5. Click **Deploy**

## What's Included

The flow contains 4 sections:

### 1. Status Monitoring
- Subscribes to `ambientika/+/state` (all devices)
- Parses the full device state (humidity, temperature, fan speed, mode, alarms)
- Shows a human-readable summary in the debug panel
- Stores state in flow context for use by other nodes

### 2. Device Control
Manual trigger buttons (inject nodes) for common commands:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Set Mode: Auto | Automatic mode (sensor-driven) |
| Set Mode: Manual | Manual high-speed ventilation |
| Set Mode: Night | Quiet night mode |
| Set Mode: Off | Standby |
| Fan Speed: Low / Medium / High | Direct fan control |
| Humidity: 60% / 70% | Set humidity setpoint |

### 3. Automation Examples
- **Auto Boost on High Humidity**: Automatically switches to ManualHigh when humidity > 75%, returns to Auto when < 60%
- **Night Mode Schedule**: Switches to Night mode at 22:00, back to Auto at 07:00 (cron-based)

### 4. Filter Alarm Notification
- Watches the `ambientika/+/filter_alarm` topic
- Triggers a notification payload when filter maintenance is required
- Connect the output to a Telegram / Pushover / Email node to receive alerts

## MQTT Topics

| Topic | Direction | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `ambientika/{serial}/state` | Subscribe | Full device state (JSON) |
| `ambientika/{serial}/filter_alarm` | Subscribe | Filter alarm status |
| `ambientika/{serial}/set/operating_mode` | Publish | Set mode (Auto, ManualHigh, Night, Standby, …) |
| `ambientika/{serial}/set/fan_speed` | Publish | Set fan speed (Low, Medium, High) |
| `ambientika/{serial}/set/humidity_setpoint` | Publish | Set humidity setpoint (40–90) |

## Configuration

1. **MQTT Broker**: Double-click the `Local MQTT Broker` configuration node and update:
   - Server (default: `localhost`)
   - Port (default: `1883`)
   - Username / Password (if authentication is enabled)

2. **Device Serial**: The flow auto-detects the serial number from the first MQTT message received.  
   Alternatively, hardcode it in any function node: replace `'YOUR_SERIAL_HERE'` with your device serial.

## Adding Push Notifications

To receive filter alarm notifications on your phone:

1. Install the **node-red-contrib-telegrambot** or **node-red-node-pushover** palette
2. Connect the output of the `Build Filter Notification` node to your notification node
3. Configure your bot token / API key
